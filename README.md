# cve-2022-44268-detector - detect malicious PNGs

cve-2022-44268-detector is a Go program that consumes PNGs and reports whether they appear to be malicious images generated by an exploit for [CVE-2022-44268][cve-2022-44268], an ImageMagick vulnerability that allows attackers to read arbitrary file contents using specially crafted images.

## Installation

To install cve-2022-44268-detector, use `go install`:

```
$ go install github.com/jnschaeffer/cve-2022-44268-detector@latest
```

## Warning

*Please be very careful* when working with untrusted data. An attacker can
craft a png chunk that may contain non-zlib data (such as a shell script,
or code that exploits a bug in your detection workflow). Accidentally
writing attacker-supplied code to a terminal or to a shell can result in
execution of malicious code. It is strongly recommended that the detector
be executed in a virtual machine or isolated compute environment to help
mitigate such security failures.

## Usage

cve-2022-44268-detector is a command line application. You can run it as follows:

```
$ cve-2022-44268-detector -filename image.png
***POTENTIAL INDICATOR OF COMPROMISE*** - found chunk with keyword 'Raw profile type' | compressed: true | id: 0 | offset: 0x72 | len: 666
```

Users may optionally output the contents of each exfiltrated chunk to stdout
by supplying the `-print` argument. *Please note* that each chunk's value is
likely binary, zlib-compressed data (i.e., not human-readable). Users are
strongly advised to redirect this data to a file.

The `-print` argument accepts the following values:

- `raw` - Write the chunk's value as-is to stdout
- `decompress` - Decompress the chunk's value prior to writing it to stdout
- `decompress-hexdecode` - Decompress and hex-decode the chunk's value
  prior to writing it to stdout. ImageMagick appears to first hex-encode
  and then compress the data using zlib compression

```
$ cve-2022-44268-detector -filename image.png -print raw > /tmp/out
***POTENTIAL INDICATOR OF COMPROMISE*** - found chunk with keyword 'Raw profile type' | compressed: true | id: 0 | offset: 0x72 | len: 666
$ hexdump -C /tmp/out
```

## Exit status

The program will exit with status 0 if a chunk with keyword `Raw profile type` was found.
